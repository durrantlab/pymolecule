## Development

We use [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) to manage Python environments and simplify the developer workflow.
Once you have [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) installed, move into `pymolecule` directory (e.g., `cd pymolecule`) and install the  environment using the command

```bash
pixi install
```

Now you can activate the new virtual environment using

```sh
pixi shell
```

## Installation

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/durrantlab/pymolecule):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/durrantlab/pymolecule
```

Install `pymolecule` using `pip` after moving into the directory.

```sh
pip install .
```

This will install all dependencies and `pymolecule` into your current Python environment.
